	-   Components: V
	-   Duration: Instantaneous
	-   Classes: Bard

	    Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.  
	    You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.  
	    You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.  
	    You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.  
	    You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.  
	    You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.  
	    If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

## Dancing Lights

	-   Casting Time: 1 action

	-   Components: V S M (A bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)
	-   Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 minute

	-   You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.  
	    As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.

	·        Range: 60 feet
	
	·        Target: The creature that damaged you
	
	·        Components: V S
	
	·        Duration: Instantaneous
	
	·        Classes: Warlock
	
	·        You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	
	·        At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

	·        Target: Self
	
	·        Components: V S
	
	·        Duration: Up to 10 minutes
	
	·        Classes: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard
	
	For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.  
	The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

## Healing Word

	·        Casting Time: 1 bonus action
	
	·        Range: 60 feet

	·        Components: V
	
	·        Duration: Instantaneous
	
	·        Classes: Bard, Cleric, Druid
	
	A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
	
	At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the Healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

## Silvery Barbs

	·       Casting Time: 1 Reaction
	
	·       Range: 60 feet
	
	·       Components: V
	
	·       Duration: Instantaneous
	
	You magically distract the triggering creature and turn its momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another creature. The triggering creature must reroll the d20 and use the lower roll. You can then choose a different creature you can see within range (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature has advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this spell at a time.

## Dissonant Whisper

	·       Range: 60 feet
	
	·       Casting Time: 1 action
	
	·       Components: V
	
	·       Duration: Instantaneous
	
	You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.
	
	At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

## Cure Wounds
	-   Casting Time: 1 action
	-   Range: Touch
	-   Target: A creature you touch
	-   Components: V S
	-   Duration: Instantaneous

	-   A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
	-   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the Healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.


# Spell Level 2


## Invisibility

	-   Casting Time: 1 action
	-   Range: Touch
	-   Target: A creature you touch
	-   Components: V S M (An eyelash encased in gum arabic)
	-   Duration: Up to 1 hour

	-   A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.
	-   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd

## Zone Of Truth

	-   Casting Time: 1 action
	-   Range: 60 feet
	-   Target: A 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range
	-   Components: V S
	-   Duration: 10 minutes
	
	-   You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.  
	    An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.

## Shatter
	-   Casting Time: 1 action
	-   Range: 60 feet
	-   Target: A point of your choice within range
	-   Components: V S M (A chip of mica)
	-   Duration: Instantaneous
	-   Classes: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
	-   A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.
	-   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

# Spell Level 3

## Tiny Hut
	-   Casting Time: 1 minute
	-   Range: Self (10-foot-radius hemisphere)
	-   Target: A 10-foot-radius around and above you
	-   Components: V S M (A small crystal bead)
	-   Duration: 8 hours
	-   Classes: Bard, Wizard
	-   A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.  
	    Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can’t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.  
	    Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.

## Clairvoyance
	-   Casting Time: 10 minutes
	-   Range: 1 mile
	-   Target: A point in range in a location familiar to you or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you
	-   Components: V S M (A focus worth at least 100 gp, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)
	-   Duration: Concentration, Up to 10 minutes
	-   Classes: Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard
	-   You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can’t be attacked or otherwise interacted with.  
	    When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.  
	    A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.

## Major Image
	-   Casting Time: 1 action
	-   Range: 120 feet
	-   Target: A spot that you can see within range
	-   Components: V S M (A bit of fleece)
	-   Duration: Concentration, Up to 10 minutes
	
	-   You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench). As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.
	-   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your Concentration.

## Hypnotic Pattern
	-   Casting Time: 1 action
	-   Range: 120 feet
	-   Target: A 30-foot cube within range
	-   Components: S M (A glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial filled with phosphorescent material)
	-   Duration: Concentration, Up to 1 minute

	-   You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.  
	    The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
# Celtic Harp

## Mage hand

	-   Casting Time: 1 action
	-   Range: 30 feet
	-   Target: A point you choose within range
	-   Components: V S
	-   Duration: 1 minute

	-   A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.  
	    You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.  
	The hand can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

## Ray of Frost

	-   Casting Time: 1 action
	-   Range: 60 feet
	-   Target: A creature within range
	-   Components: V S
	-   Duration: Instantaneous

	-   A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

## Message

	-   Casting Time: 1 action
	-   Range: 120 feet
	-   Target: A creature within range
	-   Components: V S M (A short piece of copper wire)
	-   Duration: 1 round

	-   You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.  
	    You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

## Spare the Dying

	-   Casting Time: 1 action
	-   Range: Touch
	-   Target: A living creature that has 0 hit points
	-   Components: V S
	-   Duration: Instantaneous
	-   Classes: Cleric
	-   You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.


# Bardic Inspiration
	You can inspire Others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus Action on Your Turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.
	
	Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, Attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls The D20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
	
	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
	
	Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th Level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

# College of Eloquence
## Silver Tounges
	Starting at 3rd level, you are a master at saying the right thing at the right time. When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

## Unsettling Words
	Also at 3rd level, you can spin words laced with magic that unsettle a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The creature must subtract the number rolled from the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.
